                <h2>Why the Moon? </h2>
                <p>
                    The moon is the time capsule of the early Solar System. 
                    With no atmosphere, no weather, and no plate tectonics, 
                    the Moon's surface preserves billions of years of impact history 
                    almost untouched. By reading the Moon's surface like an ancient archive, 
                    scientists can reconstruct the timeline of our Solar System's evolve through
                    the most violent meteor showers and volcanic activity.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    The moon's surface is divided into two main types of terrain:
                    the highlands and the marias. In this visualization, we focus on the
                    marias, the darker basaltic plains we often see from Earth.
            </section>

            <section class="step" data-step="2">
                <h2>What are Mare Regions?</h2>
                <p>
                    Mares are vast, dark plains formed when deep magma flooded giant impact 
                    basins billions of years ago. These plains are younger and smoother than 
                    the bright highlands, making them ideal for studying how craters accumulate! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this visualization, we focus on several key mare regions:
                    Mare Imbrium, Mare Serenitatis, Mare Tranquillitatis, and Oceanus Procellarum.
                </p>

            <section class="step" data-step="3">
                <h2>What are craters?</h2>
                <p>
                    Craters are circular depressions on the Moon's surface caused by the collision 
                    of meteoroids, asteroids, or comets. The energy released during these impacts 
                    excavates rock and ejects material, forming a bowl-shaped cavity. Larger impacts 
                    can create multi-ring basins, while smaller ones leave simple, round craters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By studying crater's evolution over time, scientists can reconstruct the history 
                    of impacts across the Solar System.
